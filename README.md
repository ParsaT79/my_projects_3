Project 3 – Practice 3 B

This is a small practice project I made while learning Python, Tkinter, and databases.
I’m still an amateur and currently learning step by step, so this project is mainly for practice and personal growth.

What it includes:

A simple Tkinter GUI for user management

SQLite database to save user information

Some basic validation with regex

⚠️ Note: This project is not meant for production use — it’s only for learning purposes.
